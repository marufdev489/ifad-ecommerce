          When you receive a payment for a order we call that payment to you a payout. Our 
          secure payment system supports several payout methods which can be set up below. 
          Go to FAQ. <br></br><br></br>

          To get paid you need to set up a payout method releases payouts about 24 hours after 
          a guestâ€™s scheduled time. The time it takes for the funds to appear in your account 
          depends on your payout method.
